We're about to start sending out more invites, so make sure you sign up for the beta at <strong><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/paper\" rel=\"nofollow\">dropbox.com/paper</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>These days I use Paper <em>constantly</em> to share everything from early ideas and sketches to full design specs (complete with my Sketch files) - getting feedback from my team every step of the way. I really hope you'll enjoy using it too.</p>\n\n<p>A ton of people have been instrumental in shaping Paper, and I specifically wanted to call out <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/tonydevincenzi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tony</a>, <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/lindaeliasen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linda</a>, <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/NickCreates\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nick</a>, <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/dhg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dave</a>, <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/davestinnette\" rel=\"nofollow\">David</a>, and <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/jermshaw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jeremiah</a> for all the love they poured into the interaction and visual design of this product.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing - you can read more about it on <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/10/dropbox-paper-all-in-one-work-tool/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wired</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/10/15/dropbox-paper-team-collaboration-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Engadget</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3052308/elasticity/meet-dropbox-paper-dropboxs-new-approach-to-collaboration\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fast Company</a>.</p>",
